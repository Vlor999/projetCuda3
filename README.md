# Assignment 03 of GPU Programming SS 2025

In the root directory you can find a CMake (version 3.16 or newer) script to generate a
build environment. A modern C++ toolchain is required to compile the framework.

## Setup
* Clone repository to directory of your choice
* Create build folder `build`, change to build folder and call `cmake .. -DCC=*`
(replace * with the compute capability of your GPU, e.g. `61`, `75` etc., alternatively use GUI to setup)
* Build (Visual Studio or `make`)
* Run: `./3dgs-render <input_dir>`

## Launch parameters:
* `<input_dir>` : Path to the input directory, which contains all necessary input files (`frameinfo.json` and five `.dat` files)

You also need to install the CUDA toolkit on your machine. In order to profile and debug GPU code, we recommend NVIDIA NSight Compute. The exercise requires an NVIDIA GPU. If you donâ€™t have a graphics card fulfilling these requirements, contact the lecturer and we will find a solution for you. If you are experiencing build problems, make sure the compiler you are using matches one of the versions recommended above, you have installed the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit version 10.x or 11.x and CMake is able to find the corresponding CUDA libraries and headers. You can change the build to different compute capabilities by toggling the CMake options `CCxx` using the CMake GUI, the CMakeCache file, or command line arguments to CMake.

## Bugs
If you encounter any bugs in the framework please do share them with us ([Michael Steiner](mailto:michael.steiner@tugraz.at?subject=[Ass03]%20Bug%20Report)), such
that we can adapt the framework.
